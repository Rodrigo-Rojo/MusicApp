# My Music App

I got the idea of building a mp3 player from realpython.com, 
I want it to build a Desktop GUI app and after of looking on internet for ideas
I found this idea in the website realpython.com

### Technologies Used:
- tkinter
- pytube
- mutagen
- pygame
- moviepy
- pyyoutube

### Tkinter:
I used tkinter because it was the first GUI that it was introduced
to me when I was first learning Python, also want it to refresh learn
more about it.

### pytube:
I used pytube to be able to download audio and play it locally.

### mutagen:
I used mutagen to show some metadata 
from the mp3 files in the app.

### pygame:
I used pygame mixer is one of the options to play music and it has access to controls
like adjusting the volume or pausing the song etc...

### moviepy:
I used moviepy because I need it to convert the songs that I was getting from pytube they are never mp3 files.

### pyyoutube:
I used pyyoutube while trying to use pytube I need it to get the url
from the videos that I want it to get, I tried to do scraping then
had the problem that doing that in youtube.com is not possible and
after doing some research found that I could do that using the Youtube API
then found pyyoutube that just with a couple of lines I have access to the Youtube API
and all the data that I need it.
